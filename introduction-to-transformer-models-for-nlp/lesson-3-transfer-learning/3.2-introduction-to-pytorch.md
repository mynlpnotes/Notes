* PyTorch is a python based scientific computing package serving two broad purposes

1. A replacement of numpy to use the power of GPUs and other accelerators
2. An automatic differentiation library that is useful to implement neural networks

* Base objects in Pytorch are tensors, which are n-dimensional arrays.
* These objects are functionally no different that arrays in numpy



```python
# 1-dimensional tensor
# A long means number
one_d_tensor = torch.LongTensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

# 2-dimensional tensor
two_d_tensor = torch.LongTensor([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])

# convert 1-dimensional tensor to 2-dimensional tensor by forcing a dimension in the front
# this is useful when we want to force a "batch" dimension if we want to predict a single example
# 0 represents at which index or which axis do we want to add a dimension
# So here if we unsqueeze 0 then it will change dimension from 1 to 2 by adding a dimension in front
# The resultant tensor is having shape 1,3 which represent that we are passing 1 data point of size 3
two_d_tensor = one_d_tensor.unsqueeze(0)

# convert from pytorch to numpy with detach which removes a tensor from a computation graph (will be useful later)
two_d_tensor.detach().numpy()

```
