# Introduction

### Introduction to NLP:

* Subfield of linguistics, computer science and AI concerned with the interactions between computers and human language
* In particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data

### Pre-requisities to learn NLP:

* Pythom
* Stats
* Basic Machine learning algo
* ANN, Optimizer, Loss function

### NLP:

* NLP can be used in ML as well as DL
* Dataset is in text and needs to be converted into numbers
*

### Why NLP?

* Google - Recommendation are based on what we search, such content recommendation is done using NLP
* Machine translation



### NLP Roadmap:

* Text preprocessing means how we can clean the data and make the data more usable

**Natural Language Processing:**

* Understanding the pattern
* Tools like nltk/spacy are not enough as things like context was missing

&#x20;     \-- e.g., bank of river and state bank of india

* so RNN came
* but RNN was also not enough so came biRNN
* then LSTM came
* then GRU came
* Then transformer came – BERT and GPT
* Transformer resulted from paper – Attention is all you need
* Initially research was more centric for English, now all languages are concentrated on. For e.g., google translate
