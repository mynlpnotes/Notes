* Example: regex to identify mail, telephone

2. **ML:**

* Learn from data without relying on rule based programming
* Applied to textual data as they are used on other forms of data sucg as images, speech and structured data
* Naive bayes, SVM, Hidden markov model

3. **DL:**

* Learns complex features in a supervised and unsupervised manner from structured data
* Deal with complex, unstructured data
* RNN, LSRM, Transformers, Autoencoders
