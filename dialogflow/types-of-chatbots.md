# Types of chatbots

1. **Rule based:**

* User is asking questions and we have some tiles, like for this Q we need to give this A
* Useful for simple QA, FAQs
* Example - Perioidic table
* To give atomic weights of the elements
* We just match the rules and give response
* Time table - When do I have my English exam

2. **AI based:**

* It learns/ understand the intent behind the question asked by the user
* It needs to be trained
* It uses NLP
* There are different frameworks - Rasa, Dialogflow
* We can also create chatbots from scratch
