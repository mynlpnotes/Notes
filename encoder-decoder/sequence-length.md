# Sequence Length

* Sentences can be of different lengths
* Today we going to learn NMT - 1st sentence
* After this we will be learning attention mechanism tomorrow - 2nd sentence
* While feeding to RNN, we need to specify sequence length
* For shorter sentence we can add padding
* For longer sentence we can split into 2
