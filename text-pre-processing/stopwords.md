# Stopwords

Hey buddy I want to go to your house

* words which are not important
* example: to, and, of
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**this are commonly used words and not useful for cases like spam classification**</mark>
* We can also have our own stopwords
* nltk has 'not' also in its stopwords, which we may not want
