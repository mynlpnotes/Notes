* Encode each word with a unique number

**Adv:**

* It will create dense representation, so it will be memory efficient

**Disadvantage:**

* It doesn’t capture any relation between among words as it is arbitrary
* Integer encoding is challenging for models
* As there is no relation between the similarities of 2 words
