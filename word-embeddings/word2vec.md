* if we compare the cosine similarity between King - Man + Woman and Queen then it will be similar
* In previous techniques, semantic meaning is not captured and sparse matrix was getting captured
* We want that for similar words the vectors should also be similar
* If we are creating vectors using word2vec we can represent using limited dimensions
* Also the vectors which gets generated will maintain the semantic meaning
