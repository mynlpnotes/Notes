# Data passing to RNN

Sentiment Analysis:

* Sentence: The food is good, Output: Positive
* This can be written as \<x11[^1] x12 x13 x14>
* At t = 1, we will pass x11
* We will first convert x11 into vector using word2vec or some other method in some dimensions
* And then this vector will be passed to the network
* At t = 2, we will pass x12 and so on
* Once forward propagation is done, then back-propagation will happen
*
