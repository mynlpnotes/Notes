# RNN Overview

* Till now for converting text to vectors, the most efficient way till now was word2vec and avgword2vec(Word embedding)
* For chatbot, we ask Q and we get A
* In such case sequence of words is very important
* Same applies for language translate, here also sequence and grammar is very important
* Text generation, for completion of sentence&#x20;
* For such tasks we need DL techniques like RNN, LSTM , RNN, Transformers and BERT
* RNN is also used for time series data



***

**RNN:**

* Great for modelling sequential data
* Speech, audio, text etc
* Use case â€“ speech recognition, language translation, stock prediction etc



***

**Text:**

* Text can also be sequence data
* Like we read L to R
* In some other language it can be R to L also



***

**Basic architecture of RNN:**

* Output is sent back to NN

* Output is given to the next timestamp of NN
