# Advantage/Disadvantage

* They still have hard time learning long term patterns in sequences of 100+ timesteps

**Solution:**

* Use conv1D to shorten the sequences
* Here itâ€™s just a 1D array over which we need to convolve
*   If sequence is of 100, filter = 4, padding = 0, then it will be 49 timestamps

GRU has fewer activation functions as well as FC units, hence it is faster than LSTM
