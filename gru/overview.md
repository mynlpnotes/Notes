# Overview

\-        Gated recurrent unit

\-        2014

\-        ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

\-        No long term state

\-        Instead of 2 states only 1, as there were too many operation, so to reduce it, there is only 1 now

\-        2 inputs and 2 outputs

\-        Use for fast and not too complex problem

\-        If higher accuracy required then go for LSTM

\-       &#x20;
